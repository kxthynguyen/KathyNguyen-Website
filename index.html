        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Kathy Nguyen, I was born and raised in San Jose. I attend the Unversity of California, Riverside and will be graduating in the year 2022. I am currently majoring in psychology because I want to be an Occupational Therapist. I only have one older brother name Kevin Nguyen. On my free time, I like to spend time with friends and gym. I have lived in San Jose most of my life until 2018 I moved to Riverside to go to school here. I really interested in the psychology field because people are interesting and I want to learn about them. I love to interact with people and hope that patients will get back on their feet. I have experience working with people because I worked at Hollister at Eastridge mall. At this job, we had to have exceptional customer service to make the customers feel welcomed. I also had to fold clothes and keep the clothing store very tidy. I had to organize the shirt by sizes and put the clothes back in the closets. I would also have dust the store and clean the mirrors, so it can be a new representation to customers.<br><br>

        At this job, we would have updates and this is when it challenged us, workers. I am a hard-working person, I was able to learn how to build closets and organize the clothes by their skew number. We had to follow a picture and set it up just like it, it is just like coding, we had to make sure everything is correct when we compared it to the picture. It tested our abilities because sometimes the item they wanted would not be found in the store and we would have to look throughout the store for it. I am also a persistent person, I will always try my best to complete any task. That job taught me to be more outgoing interacting with customers. We would always have to ask customers how they are doing and if they needed help finding a size. We made sure they felt comfortable in our store.<br><br>

        I worked at Hollister for a year and six months. It was my first job, and the first interview I have gotten. I would also be on register a lot talking to customers and placing their items into a bag. I was able to get the employee the first month I started there in July. I was able to meet many new people and be close to my bosses. I went through five bosses the time I was there. There were always new employees coming in because Hollister likes to showcase new faces. I had to quit this job because I moved to Southern California. I liked working there and it taught me a lot. I learned how to provide good customer service and fold clothes properly. I learned that every Hollister has the same playlist and the set up of the store is the same. Working is fun when you are around people you enjoy.
